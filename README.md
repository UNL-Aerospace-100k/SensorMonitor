For programming the Teensy 4.1 on the remote test stand site board

This Teensy is able to recieve a simple pulse from the SubmasterController indicating it to begin looping over the data collection. It is designed to be expandable as the project and the testing requirements grow. 

Data is collected by reading the output of a load cell through an amplifier, and is stored into an SD card on the Teensy.

This device is still a good fit for the program, do not depreciate yet.
